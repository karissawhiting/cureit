- `compare-predict-brier-with-yardstick_P2.R` - compare yardstick prediction and brier using our simulation data. Using new predict_cure() compare Teng's manual brier score calc to yardstick brier score calc


- `compare-predict-brier-with-yardstick_P1.R` - compare yardstick prediction and brier using their example data

- `compare-predict-brier-with-yardstick_P1.R` - misc comparison code (need to review this)

- `run-simulations.R` - produce simulated data for lasso cure models

- `archive`
	- `evaluate-simulations.R` - old code to calculate brier score on simulations (modified from Teng)
	- `testcode.R` - old code to calculate brier score
